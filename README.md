For Part 1, running "move_to_rear.cpp" will call the function move_to_rear. The function will create a queue with five integers and print out the first integer. This first integer will be saved, then popped and pushed back into the end of the queue. The function will now print the first element after this change.

For Part 2, after you run the "palindrome.cpp" file, you will be asked to enter a word to check if it is a palindrome. Simply enter any word and you will receive the message: "The word is a palindrome" or "The word is NOT a palindrome" depending on the case.

For part 5 (number 5 on the assignment), a map is declared and the 6 pairs of cities and states are inserted as pairs as instructed. A print function is then called which prints all data in the map. The city corresponding to California is then changed to "Los Angeles". The print function is called again to show the change.
